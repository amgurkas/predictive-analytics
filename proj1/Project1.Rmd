## Executive Summary
### Part A - ATM Forecast
The ATM analysis forecasts cash withdrawals for four ATM machines for May 2010. 
Per the assignment interpretation, we provide **monthly total forecasts** for 
each ATM. 

*Key findings:*
- **ATM1 and ATM4 share identical data** (except for one outlier), suggesting 
ATM4 may be a data entry error
- **ATM2** shows distinct patterns with generally lower withdrawal amounts
- **ATM3** only has 3 days of data, requiring special handling
- We forecast monthly totals: ATM1 (\~2,558), ATM2 (\~1,760), ATM3 (estimated), ATM4 (same as ATM1)
- Strong **day-of-week effects** exist within the monthly patterns

**Note on Interpretation**: The assignment asks to "forecast how much cash is 
taken out for May 2010." We interpret this as forecasting the total monthly 
amount for May 2010, consistent with the student's original approach.

### Part B - Forecasting Power
This analysis explored monthly residential energy usage from January 1998 to 
December 2013, using exploratory data analysis, decomposition techniques, and 
time series forecasting to project energy consumption for 2014.

Key Findings:
- Data cleaning confirmed 191 complete monthly observations with no missing values or duplicates.
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations (histogram, boxplot) revealed a right-skewed distribution in energy usage with increasing variability over time.
- Time series visualization showed a gradual upward trend beginning in the mid-2000s, accelerating notably between 2008 and 2013.
- Seasonal plots (line and subseries) demonstrated clear recurring monthly patterns, indicating strong seasonality in consumption.
- STL decomposition separated the data into trend, seasonal, and remainder components, revealing: a strong upward trend from 2008–2013, stable and clear seasonality, increasing residual variation, suggesting rising unpredictability in energy use.
- Forecasting for 2014 using STL-adjusted dataprojected a slight continued increase in energy usage, with seasonal fluctuations and widening confidence intervals over the forecast horizon.

The results indicate that energy usage is expected to continue rising in 2014, 
driven by long-term demand growth and seasonal demand patterns, though increasing 
variability in recent years suggests a growing degree of uncertainty in 
forecasting future consumption.

### Part C - Waterflow 
This analysis provides a comprehensive water flow forecasting system for a dual-pipe water distribution network. The analysis includes:

-   Hourly aggregation of sub-hourly water flow measurements
-   Exploratory data analysis to identify temporal patterns
-   Time series modeling using multiple approaches with focus on capturing daily seasonality
-   7-day ahead forecasts with uncertainty quantification
-   Individual pipe flow predictions based on historical contribution ratios

##### Identifying and Handling Outliers

```{r outliers}
# creating a function to detect outliers using quantiles and IQR
identify_outliers <- function(x) {
  Q1 <- quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
  Q3 <- quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
  IQR <- Q3 - Q1
  lower <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
  upper <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
  return(x < lower | x > upper)
}

outliers <- ATM_complete %>%
  group_by(ATM) %>%
  mutate(is_outlier = identify_outliers(Cash)) %>%
  filter(is_outlier & !is.na(Cash))

print("Detected outliers:")
print(outliers)

# Creating impute function that considers day-of-week and seasonal patterns
impute_value <- function(data, atm_id, target_date, window_weeks = 8) {
  target_wday <- wday(target_date)
  
  # Get similar days within the window
  similar_days <- data %>%
    filter(
      ATM == atm_id,
      DATE >= target_date - weeks(window_weeks),

      wday(DATE) == target_wday,
      DATE != target_date,
      !is.na(Cash)
    ) %>%
    arrange(abs(as.numeric(DATE - target_date)))
  
  if(nrow(similar_days) >= 3) {
    # Use weighted average giving more weight to closer dates
    weights <- 1 / (1 + abs(as.numeric(similar_days$DATE - target_date)) / 7)
    return(weighted.mean(similar_days$Cash, weights))
  } else {
    # Fallback to simple mean if not enough similar days
    return(mean(similar_days$Cash, na.rm = TRUE))
  }
}

# Apply imputation for missing values and extreme outliers
ATM_clean <- ATM_complete

# Handle known issues
# ATM2 missing value on 2009-10-25

    cat("Imputed ATM4 2010-02-09 outlier. Original:", original_value, "New:", imputed_value, "\n")
  }
}
```

##### Checking for Duplicate Data
```{r duplicate-check}
# Compare all pairs of ATMs
atm_comparison <- ATM_clean %>%
  select(DATE, ATM, Cash) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ATM, values_from = Cash)

# Calculate correlations between ATMs
cor_matrix <- cor(atm_comparison[,-1], use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
print("Correlation matrix between ATMs:")
print(round(cor_matrix, 3))

# Check if ATM1 and ATM4 are identical
if("ATM1" %in% names(atm_comparison) && "ATM4" %in% names(atm_comparison)) {
  atm1_vs_atm4 <- atm_comparison %>%
    filter(!is.na(ATM1) & !is.na(ATM4)) %>%
    mutate(difference = ATM1 - ATM4)
  
  cat("\nATM1 vs ATM4 comparison:\n")
  cat("Number of matching days:", sum(atm1_vs_atm4$difference == 0), "\n")
  cat("Number of different days:", sum(atm1_vs_atm4$difference != 0), "\n")
  cat("Max absolute difference:", max(abs(atm1_vs_atm4$difference)), "\n")
}
```

#### Forecasting Approach

##### Strategy for Each ATM

Based on our analysis: 1. **ATM1**: Full year of data, suitable for time series modeling 2. **ATM2**: Full year of data, suitable for time series modeling\
3. **ATM3**: Only 3 days of data - will use simple averaging approach 4. **ATM4**: Nearly identical to ATM1 - will use ATM1 model with adjustments

```{r prepare-modeling-data}
# IMPROVEMENT: Aggregate to monthly totals for monthly forecasting
# While keeping daily patterns in mind for better understanding

# Filter to training period (through April 2010)
train_end <- as.Date("2010-04-30")

# Create monthly aggregated data
ATM_monthly <- ATM_clean %>%
  filter(DATE <= train_end) %>%
  mutate(Month = floor_date(DATE, "month")) %>%
  group_by(ATM, Month) %>%
  summarise(
    TotalCash = sum(Cash, na.rm = TRUE),
    DaysInMonth = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Create time series objects for ATM1 and ATM2 (monthly data)
ATM1_monthly_ts <- ts(
  ATM_monthly %>% filter(ATM == "ATM1") %>% pull(TotalCash),
  start = c(2009, 5),
  frequency = 12
)

ATM2_monthly_ts <- ts(
  ATM_monthly %>% filter(ATM == "ATM2") %>% pull(TotalCash),

##### Model Selection and Fitting

```{r model-fitting}
# Use appropriate models for monthly forecasting with limited data

# For ATM1
cat("=== ATM1 Models ===\n")

# With only 12 months of data, simpler models are more appropriate
# 1. ETS
ATM1_ets <- ets(ATM1_monthly_ts)
ATM1_ets_fc <- forecast(ATM1_ets, h = 1)

# 2. ARIMA 
ATM1_arima <- auto.arima(ATM1_monthly_ts, seasonal = FALSE) # Not enough data for seasonality
ATM1_arima_fc <- forecast(ATM1_arima, h = 1)

# 3. Simple Exponential Smoothing
ATM1_ses <- ses(ATM1_monthly_ts, h = 1)

# 4. Holt's method (for trend)
ATM1_holt <- holt(ATM1_monthly_ts, h = 1)

# Compare accuracy
cat("\nModel comparison for ATM1:\n")
accuracy_ATM1 <- rbind(
  ETS = accuracy(ATM1_ets_fc)[1,],
  ARIMA = accuracy(ATM1_arima_fc)[1,],
  SES = accuracy(ATM1_ses)[1,],
  Holt = accuracy(ATM1_holt)[1,]
)

)
print(round(accuracy_ATM2[,c("RMSE", "MAE", "MAPE")], 2))

# Select best models based on RMSE
best_model_ATM1 <- rownames(accuracy_ATM1)[which.min(accuracy_ATM1[,"RMSE"])]
best_model_ATM2 <- rownames(accuracy_ATM2)[which.min(accuracy_ATM2[,"RMSE"])]

### Summary and Recommendations - Part A - ATM Analysis

##### Key Improvements Made:

1.  **Complete Coverage**: Provided forecasts for all 4 ATMs (original only had ATM1 and ATM2)
2.  **Better Data Handling**: Systematic outlier detection and imputation
3.  **Appropriate Methods**: Used models suitable for limited monthly data
4.  **Duplicate Detection**: Identified and handled ATM1/ATM4 duplication issue
5.  **Professional Format**: Clear documentation and business-friendly explanations

###### Methodology Summary:

-   **ATM1 & ATM2**: Used ETS models for monthly forecasting with 12 months of historical data
-   **ATM3**: Estimated based on 3 days of available data (daily average × 31 days)
-   **ATM4**: Used ATM1 forecast due to identical historical patterns

### Key Findings - Part A - ATM Analysis

1.  **Data Quality Issues**:
    -   ATM4 appears to duplicate ATM1 data (364 out of 365 days identical)
    -   ATM3 only has 3 days of data (April 28-30, 2010)
    -   One missing value in ATM2 (successfully imputed)
2.  **Forecast Results** (Monthly Totals for May 2010):
    -   ATM1: \~2,558 (hundreds of dollars)
    -   ATM2: \~1,760 (hundreds of dollars)
    -   ATM3: Estimated based on limited data
    -   ATM4: Same as ATM1 due to duplication
3.  **Model Performance**:
    -   ETS models performed well for both ATM1 and ATM2
    -   Residuals show no significant autocorrelation
    -   Forecasts include 80% and 95% confidence intervals

### Recommendations - Part A - ATM Analysis

1.  **Data Collection**:
    -   Investigate why ATM4 duplicates ATM1 data
    -   Ensure ATM3 data collection is working properly
2.  **Forecast Monitoring**:
    -   Track actual May 2010 values against forecasts
    -   Update models monthly as new data becomes available
3.  **Business Insights**:
    -   ATM2 consistently shows lower usage than ATM1
    -   Strong day-of-week patterns suggest different customer behaviors
    -   Consider consolidating ATM4 if truly duplicate

### Next Steps - Part A - ATM Analysis

-   Implement automated anomaly detection for future data quality issues
-   Consider external factors (holidays, paydays) for improved accuracy
-   Develop ensemble forecasting methods once more data is available


## Part B - Forecasting Power Analysis

#### Loading the excel spreadsheet data
```{r load-energy-data}
raw_data <- read_excel("ResidentialCustomerForecastLoad-624.xlsx")
```

#### Checking the Structure of the data
The data has the columns, "CaseSequence" (numeric), "YYYY-MMM" (character strings), 
and "KWH" (numeric), and 192 observations. 
```{r eda-check-str}
str(raw_data)
```
#### Identifying Duplicate and Missing Values
To forecast this data, it is necessary to check for duplicative or missing values.
Duplicate values can skew data, and many forecasting models assume regular time 
interval with one value per period. Missing values should also be handled through 
imputations or removed. Otherwise, this can return errors when using functions 
such as stl() and missing values can distort trend detection, weaken seasonal 
signals, and reduce forecast quality.
```{r eda-na-missing}
dups <- raw_data |>  
  group_by_all() |>  
  filter(n() > 1) |>  # taking a count of the duplicative values
  ungroup()

missing <- colSums(is.na(raw_data)) # taking the sum of the missing values 
```

#### Data Cleaning:
```{r rem-na}
data <- raw_data |> 
  na.omit() |> # removing missing values
  mutate(date=as.Date(paste0(`YYYY-MMM`,"-01"), format = "%Y-%b-%d")) |> #formatting dates
  select(-`YYYY-MMM`) # removing the `YYYY-MMM` column
```

#### Summarizing the Data
Summary statistics can be used to get a general understanding of the data's 
distribution, central tendency, and variability. There's a wide spread between 
the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) energy usage values. The 
interquartile range is the spread between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The IQR
is significantly smaller than the full range (from min to max). This implies that 
most data points are clustered in a smaller region, but there are a few very 
large values stretching the distribution. The standard deviation measures how much 
values typically deviate from the mean. The standard deviation is high relative 
to the mean, suggesting that the data is fairly spread out.

```{r summarize-kwh}
# Summarize KWH values (min, max, mean, quantiles).
summary <- data |> 
  summarise(
    min = min(KWH), # min value calc
    max = max(KWH), # max value calc
    mean = mean(KWH), # mean value calc
    iqr = IQR(KWH), # interquartile range calc
    sd= sd(KWH) # standard deviation calc
  )
summary
```

#### Calculating the quantiles 
```{r quantiles-calc}
p <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75) # defining the proportions
p_names <- map_chr(p, ~paste0(.x*100, "%")) # multiplying proportions by 100 and adding "%"
p_funs <- map(p, ~partial(quantile, probs = .x, na.rm = TRUE)) |>  # defining the funct. 
  set_names(nm = p_names) # setting the col names

map(p_funs, ~ .x(data$KWH)) |> as_tibble_row() # applying prop. funct to the KWH data
```
Since the median value, i.e., 50%, is closer to q1 than q3, and the mean is 
higher than the median, the data appears to be slightly right-skewed 
(positively skewed). This may be influenced by higher outliers or a long upper 
tail.


### Plotting the Distribution
To better understand the distribution and spread of the data, a histogram can be
used.
###### Setting the binwidth  
```{r calc-binwidth}
binwidth <- 2 * IQR(data$KWH) / nrow(data)^(1/3) #calculating binwidth using the Freedman-Diaconis Rule (good for skewed or non-normal data)
```

#### Distribution of Energy Use 
```{r histo}
options(scipen=999)

ggplot(raw_data, aes(x = KWH)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6, 
                 position = "identity", 
                 binwidth = binwidth) +
  geom_density(
    aes(y = ..density..* binwidth * nrow(data)), 
    alpha = 0.2, 
    color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Energy Use",
    x = "Kilowatts per Hour", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
As anticipated, the data is slightly right-skewed and is somewhat bimodal. To 
better understand the outliers, a boxplot can be used to visualize the spread. 

#### Boxplot of Energy Use
```{r boxplot}
ggplot(data, aes(y=KWH)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill="lightblue", color="darkblue") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Boxplot of Kilowatts per Hour", y="Kilowatts per Hour")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
As seen in this boxplot, the data is not evenly spread, and there is one outlier.
The data is right skewed. 

#### Time Series of Residential Energy Usage
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = `date`, y = KWH)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Time Series of Energy Usage", x = "Date", y = "Kilowatts per Hour")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
When plotting the time series, it is evident that there is a slight increase in
energy use over time. This time series plot indicates there is additive seasonality.
There is also one outlier, from July 2010. The decrease in energy use may be 
legitimate, or an error. Across the US, the energy use in July 2010 did not 
decrease, however, there was a ConEd power outage in New York City, in July 2010, 
which may explain this value. 

#### Seasonal Plots
```{r seasonal-patterns}
data_seasonal <- data |> 
  mutate(
    month = month(date),
    year = year(date)
  )

data_seasonal$month <- factor(month.abb[as.numeric(data_seasonal$month)],
                              levels = month.abb)

ggplot(data_seasonal, aes(x = month, y = KWH, group = year, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Seasonal Line Plot of Energy Usage",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Kilowatts per Hour",
    color = "Year"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
From the Seasonal Line Plot of Energy Use, it is clear that energy use generally
peaks from June-September and December-February. Energy use seems to be the 
lowest in May and November.

#### Seasonal Subseries Plot
```{r subseries-plot}
ggplot(data_seasonal, aes(x = year, y = KWH)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  facet_wrap(~month)+
  labs(
    title = "Seasonal Subseries of Energy Use",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Kilowatts per Hour",
    color = "Year"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
From the Seasonal Subseries Energy Use Plot, it is evident that energy use is 
generally increasing over time. Although for August, it is beginning to trend 
downward. 

#### Converting the data to a time series
To model and forecast the data, the data should be converted from a dataframe 
to a time series. To do this, the start year and start month should be defined.
```{r convert-ts}
start_year <- year(min(data$date)) #defining the start year
start_month <- month(min(data$date)) #defining the start month

ts_data <- ts(data$KWH, # selecting the predictor
              start = c(start_year, start_month), #defining the start year and date
              frequency = 12) #defining the frequency (monthly)
```

#### Decomposing the data
Data decomposition separates the time series into different components such as
observed, trend, seasonal, and random fluctuations (or noise). Noise is calculated
as:
$Noise = ObservedValue - Estimated Trend - Estimated Seasonality$

The noise should be relatively small, random, normally distributed, and have no
autocorrelation in order to model and forecast the data. 
```{r ts-decomp}
decomposed <- decompose(ts_data, type = "additive") #specifying the type of seasonal component (additive)
plot(decomposed)
```

#### Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) Decomposition 
STL decomposition may be preferable to classic decomposition if the seasonality
is changing over time. For this dataset, it would be preferable as the summers
are getting hotter over time. When using STL, it provides the original data, the
seasonal trend, the overall trend, and the remainder (residual/noise) component.
```{r stl-decomp}
stl <- stl(ts_data, s.window = "periodic",robust=TRUE) #setting robust=TRUE to handle outliers
plot(stl)
```
From the STL plot, the trend is increasing over time, especially within the last
decade. Additionally, the noise is increasing from 2008 onward. This indicates that
while the seasonality had an additive trend, it seems to be becoming multiplicative. 

####  Forecasting 
From 2008 to 2013, the STL decomposition shows a significant upward trend in 
energy usage, suggesting systemic increases in demand. Meanwhile, the residual 
component becomes more variable in this period, indicating increased 
unpredictability not explained by seasonal or trend effects. To forecast the data,
seasonality can be removed using seaadj() and a naive forecast is used. 

By using a naive forecast, it uses the most recent actual value as the forecast 
for the next period.
```{r stl-forecast}
# forecasting the STL decomposition output using the seasonally adjusted output,
# and a naive forecast 
stl |>  
  seasadj() |>  
  naive() |> 
  autoplot() + ylab("Energy Usage in KWH") +
  ggtitle("Forecasts of Seasonally Adjusted Energy Data")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
Using these methods, the forecast for 2014 has a wide range.

## Forecasting for 2014 Energy Use

### Error, Trend, and Seasonality (ETS) Modeling
Since the residuals and overall trend are increasing but the trend and 
seasonality are strong and well-separated, a forecasting model like ETS should be 
used to project energy use in 2014.

```{r 2014-forecast}
adjusted_series <- seasadj(stl) #seasonally adjusting the stl decomposition
ets_model <- ets(adjusted_series) #modeling the adjusted series
forecast_2014 <- forecast(ets_model, h = 12) #forecasting for the next 12 periods (next year)

autoplot(forecast_2014)+ #plotting the forecast output
ylab("Energy Usage in KWH") +
ggtitle("Forecasts for 2014 Energy Data")+
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The forecast for 2014 energy usage suggests a continuation of the upward trend 
observed between 2008 and 2013, with recurring seasonal peaks. The model 
projects that energy consumption will continue to be higher compared to earlier 
years, reflecting an increased baseline demand. Forecast uncertainty (seen in the 
plot as the shaded confidence intervals) widens over time, which aligns with the 
STL decomposition output depicting increased residual volatility. 

#### Creating a 2014 data frame
```{r produce-kwh-2014-df}
kwh_2014 <- tibble(
  date = seq(ymd("2014-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 12), # creating date col
  KWH = as.numeric(forecast_2014$mean) # populating forecasted values as KWH
) |> 
mutate(
  CaseSequence=row_number() + 924, # adding case sequence to be uniform w/ excel spreadsheet
  "YYYY-MMM"= format(date, "%Y-%b") #formatting dates to match original data 
) |> 
select(CaseSequence,`YYYY-MMM`,`KWH`)
```

#### Exporting results to the excel spreadsheet
```{r produce-excel, eval=FALSE}
wb <- loadWorkbook("ResidentialCustomerForecastLoad-624.xlsx") #loading the workbook
addWorksheet(wb, "KWH-2014-Forecast") # adding the spreadsheet
writeData(wb, "KWH-2014-Forecast", kwh_2014) # adding the 2014 forecasted data
saveWorkbook(wb, "ResidentialCustomerForecastLoad-624.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE) #saving the workbook and overwriting the existing file
```

### Summary and Recommendations – Part B – Residential Energy Forecasting
##### Key Improvements Made:
*Data Preparation*: Cleaned 192 months of residential energy usage data (1998–2013) and removed one missing value.
*Exploratory Analysis*: Assessed trends, distribution, and seasonality using time series visualizations and decomposition plots.
*Decomposition*: Applied STL to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components.
*Forecasting*: Developed a monthly forecast for 2014 using seasonally adjusted data and ETS modeling.

#### Methodology Summary:
- Used STL decomposition with additive seasonal adjustment
- Modeled 2014 forecasts using naive() on the seasonally adjusted series
- Evaluated trend, seasonality, and residuals using visual and statistical diagnostics

#### Key Findings – Part B – Energy Analysis
*Trend*: Energy usage showed a significant increase from 2008 to 2013.
*Seasonality*: Strong monthly seasonal effects were consistently present.
*Residuals*: Increasing variability post-2008 suggests growing forecast uncertainty.
*Forecast*: 2014 projections indicate a continued upward trend in usage, with confidence intervals widening over time.

### Next Steps – Part B – Energy Analysis
*Monitor Forecast Accuracy*: 
- Compare actual 2014 values to projected usage.
- Use residual diagnostics to refine model assumptions over time.
*Plan for Volatility*:
- Increasing noise suggests the need to account for external variability in future planning.
- Consider more flexible models (e.g., ARIMA, ensemble methods) if forecast error increases.
*Expand Model Inputs*:
Future models could include exogenous factors (e.g., weather, population growth) to improve predictive power.

## Part B - Forecasting Power Analysis

### Introduction

Water flow forecasting is critical for effective water resource management and infrastructure planning. This analysis develops predictive models for total water flow based on historical data from two pipes in the distribution system.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

```{r load-data}
cat("\n========== PART C: WATER FLOW FORECAST ==========\n\n")

# Load data
pipe1_data <- read_excel("Waterflow_Pipe1.xlsx")
pipe2_data <- read_excel("Waterflow_Pipe2.xlsx")

# Rename columns
names(pipe1_data) <- c("DateTime", "WaterFlow")
names(pipe2_data) <- c("DateTime", "WaterFlow")

# Convert to POSIXct
pipe1_data$DateTime <- as.POSIXct(pipe1_data$DateTime)
pipe2_data$DateTime <- as.POSIXct(pipe2_data$DateTime)

cat("Data loaded successfully\n")
cat("Pipe 1 records:", nrow(pipe1_data), "\n")
cat("Pipe 2 records:", nrow(pipe2_data), "\n\n")

# Examine temporal patterns
cat("Temporal characteristics:\n")
cat("Pipe 1 - Time span:", 
    round(as.numeric(difftime(max(pipe1_data$DateTime), 
                              min(pipe1_data$DateTime), 
                              units = "days")), 1), "days\n")
cat("Pipe 2 - Time span:", 
    round(as.numeric(difftime(max(pipe2_data$DateTime), 
                              min(pipe2_data$DateTime), 
                              units = "days")), 1), "days\n")
```

### Step 1: Hourly Aggregation

The raw data contains sub-hourly measurements at different frequencies. We aggregate these to hourly intervals for more stable time series analysis.

#### Handle Different Recording Frequencies

```{r hourly-aggregation}
cat("STEP 1: Aggregating to hourly intervals...\n\n")

# Function for robust hourly aggregation
aggregate_hourly <- function(data, pipe_name) {
  result <- data %>%
    mutate(Hour = floor_date(DateTime, "hour")) %>%
    group_by(Hour) %>%
    summarise(
      WaterFlow = mean(WaterFlow, na.rm = TRUE),
      n_readings = n(),
      .groups = 'drop'
    )
  
  cat(pipe_name, "- Readings per hour summary:\n")
  print(summary(result$n_readings))
  
  return(result)
}

pipe1_hourly <- aggregate_hourly(pipe1_data, "Pipe 1")
pipe2_hourly <- aggregate_hourly(pipe2_data, "Pipe 2")

cat("\nPipe 1 - Hourly data points:", nrow(pipe1_hourly), "\n")
cat("Pipe 2 - Hourly data points:", nrow(pipe2_hourly), "\n\n")
```

#### Align Time Series

```{r align-timeseries}
# Find the common time range
start_time <- max(min(pipe1_hourly$Hour), min(pipe2_hourly$Hour))
end_time <- min(max(pipe1_hourly$Hour), max(pipe2_hourly$Hour))

cat("Common time range:\n")
cat("Start:", format(start_time), "\n")
cat("End:", format(end_time), "\n")

# Create complete hourly sequence
hourly_seq <- seq(from = start_time, to = end_time, by = "hour")
complete_hours <- data.frame(Hour = hourly_seq)
cat("Total hours in sequence:", length(hourly_seq), "\n\n")

# Join and interpolate
pipe1_complete <- complete_hours %>%
  left_join(pipe1_hourly, by = "Hour") %>%
  mutate(
    WaterFlow_interp = na.approx(WaterFlow, na.rm = FALSE, maxgap = 3),
    # For remaining NAs, use seasonal naive approach
    WaterFlow_final = ifelse(is.na(WaterFlow_interp),
                            na.aggregate(WaterFlow, FUN = mean),
                            WaterFlow_interp)
  )

pipe2_complete <- complete_hours %>%
  left_join(pipe2_hourly, by = "Hour") %>%
  mutate(
    WaterFlow_interp = na.approx(WaterFlow, na.rm = FALSE, maxgap = 3),
    WaterFlow_final = ifelse(is.na(WaterFlow_interp),
                            na.aggregate(WaterFlow, FUN = mean),
                            WaterFlow_interp)
  )

# Create total flow
total_flow <- data.frame(
  DateTime = complete_hours$Hour,
  Pipe1 = pipe1_complete$WaterFlow_final,
  Pipe2 = pipe2_complete$WaterFlow_final,
  Total = pipe1_complete$WaterFlow_final + pipe2_complete$WaterFlow_final
) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Total))

cat("Total hourly observations after aggregation:", nrow(total_flow), "\n")
cat("Missing values in final dataset:", sum(is.na(total_flow$Total)), "\n\n")
```

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r exploratory-analysis, fig.height=10}
cat("STEP 2: Creating exploratory visualizations...\n")

# Plot 1: Individual pipe flows over time

  labs(title = "Hourly Water Flow by Pipe",
       x = "Date", y = "Water Flow", color = "Source") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Pipe 1" = "blue", "Pipe 2" = "red"))

# Plot 2: Total water flow

       x = "Date", y = "Total Water Flow") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE, alpha = 0.2)

# Plot 3: Hourly pattern
hourly_pattern <- total_flow %>%
  mutate(Hour = hour(DateTime)) %>%
  group_by(Hour) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Flow = mean(Total, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Flow = sd(Total, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

p3 <- ggplot(hourly_pattern, aes(x = Hour, y = Mean_Flow)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Mean_Flow - SD_Flow,
                  ymax = Mean_Flow + SD_Flow),

       subtitle = "Mean ± 1 Standard Deviation",
       x = "Hour of Day", y = "Average Total Flow") +

# Plot 4: Distribution
p4 <- ggplot(total_flow, aes(x = Total)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +
  geom_density(aes(y = after_stat(count)), color = "red", size = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Total Water Flow",
       x = "Total Water Flow", y = "Frequency")

# Combine plots
exploratory_plots <- grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
```

#### Key Observations

-   **Flow Patterns**: Both pipes show similar temporal patterns with regular daily fluctuations
-   **Daily Cycle**: Clear 24-hour periodicity with peak flows during daytime hours
-   **Distribution**: Total flow appears approximately normally distributed
-   **Trend**: No obvious long-term trend visible in the data

### Step 3: Time Series Modeling

```{r timeseries-prep}

cat("Series is", ifelse(adf_test$p.value < 0.05, "stationary", "non-stationary"), "\n\n")
```

#### Time Series Decomposition

```{r decomposition, fig.height=8}

#### Forecasted Daily Pattern

```{r forecast-pattern}
# Forecast pattern plot

### Step 6: Model Diagnostics

```{r diagnostics, fig.height=8}
cat("\nSTEP 6: Checking model diagnostics...\n")

# Get the actual model used for forecasting
if(exists("final_forecast") && !is.null(final_forecast$model)) {
  checkresiduals(final_forecast$model)
} else {
  checkresiduals(model_stlf$model)
}

# Additional diagnostic: forecast vs historical pattern comparison
historical_pattern <- total_flow %>%
  mutate(Hour = hour(DateTime)) %>%
  group_by(Hour) %>%
  summarise(Historical = mean(Total), .groups = 'drop')

pattern_comparison <- forecast_pattern %>%
  select(Hour, Forecast = Mean_Forecast) %>%
  left_join(historical_pattern, by = "Hour") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Forecast, Historical), names_to = "Type", values_to = "Flow")

p_compare <- ggplot(pattern_comparison, aes(x = Hour, y = Flow, color = Type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +

```

### Step 7: Export Results

```{r export-results}
cat("\nSTEP 7: Exporting results to Excel...\n")

# Create forecast dataframes for each pipe
pipe1_forecast <- forecast_df %>%
  mutate(
    DateTime = DateTime,
    WaterFlow = Forecast * pipe1_pct
  ) %>%
  select(DateTime, WaterFlow)

pipe2_forecast <- forecast_df %>%
  mutate(
    DateTime = DateTime,
    WaterFlow = Forecast * pipe2_pct
  ) %>%
  select(DateTime, WaterFlow)

# Create summary statistics
summary_stats <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Total observations", "Forecast period (hours)", 
             "Best model", "Average historical flow", 
             "Average forecasted flow", "Forecast range",
             "Pipe 1 percentage", "Pipe 2 percentage"),
  Value = c(nrow(total_flow), 168,
            ifelse(exists("best_model_name"), best_model_name, "STL+ETS"),
            round(mean(total_flow$Total, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
            round(mean(forecast_df$Forecast), 2),
            round(forecast_range, 2),
            paste0(round(pipe1_pct * 100, 1), "%"),
            paste0(round(pipe2_pct * 100, 1), "%"))
)

# Create Excel workbook
excel_list <- list(
  "Summary" = summary_stats,
  "Water_Forecast_Total" = forecast_df,
  "Water_Forecast_Pipe1" = pipe1_forecast,
  "Water_Forecast_Pipe2" = pipe2_forecast
)

write_xlsx(excel_list, "Water_Flow_Forecasts.xlsx")
cat("Results exported to Water_Flow_Forecasts.xlsx\n")
```

### Summary of Results

```{r summary}
cat("\n========== ANALYSIS COMPLETE ==========\n\n")
cat("Summary of Results:\n")
cat("-----------------\n")

# Display summary statistics
kable(summary_stats, caption = "Analysis Summary")
```

### Key Findings

1.  **Model Selection**: The analysis compared multiple models to capture seasonal patterns effectively
2.  **Flow Distribution**: Pipe 1 contributes `r round(pipe1_pct * 100, 1)`% and Pipe 2 contributes `r round(pipe2_pct * 100, 1)`% to total flow
3.  **Seasonal Patterns**: The forecast captures daily variations in water usage
4.  **Uncertainty**: 80% and 95% confidence intervals provide robust uncertainty estimates

## Files Created

The analysis generates the following output files:

-   `water_flow_exploration.png` - Exploratory data analysis plots
-   `water_flow_decomposition.png` - Time series decomposition
-   `water_flow_forecast.png` - Main forecast visualization
-   `water_flow_forecast_pattern.png` - Daily pattern forecast
-   `water_flow_residuals.png` - Model diagnostic plots
-   `Water_Flow_Forecasts.xlsx` - Excel file with all forecasts
